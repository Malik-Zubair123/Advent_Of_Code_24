## **🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄**
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! 🎉 Here, I’ll be solving the daily coding challenges from Advent of Code and sharing my solutions. Each day's folder includes the problem description, input file, and Python solution.

## **📁 Folder Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:

├── day01/
│   ├── problem.txt   # Day 1 problem description
│   ├── input.txt     # Input data for Day 1
│   └── solution.py   # Python solution for Day 1
├── day02/
│   ├── problem.txt   # Day 2 problem description
│   ├── input.txt     # Input data for Day 2
│   └── solution.py   # Python solution for Day 2
└── ...

## **🧑‍💻 How to Use**
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the dayX folder (where X is the day number) to access:
problem.txt: The day’s problem statement.
input.txt: Input data for the challenge.
solution.py: Python script for solving the challenge.
Run solution.py in your preferred Python environment.
Use input.txt to test the solution.

## **⚙️ Technologies Used**
Python 🐍 (Primary language for solutions)
Additional tools or languages may be used depending on the challenge.

## **📜 Daily Updates**
A new folder will be added each day containing the problem, input, and solution. Stay tuned for daily updates as I tackle these exciting challenges! 🎁
